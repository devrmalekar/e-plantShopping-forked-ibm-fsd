# üõí React Final Practice Project : E-Plant Shopping IBM FSD

This is my own customized version of an E-Plant Shopping  project, originally introduced as part of the **IBM Full Stack Developer course**. The project was focused on learning:
- React Components: Create functional React components using component composition and nesting.
- State Management with Hooks: Implement React Hooks, specifically the useState and useEffect hooks; manage component-level state using hooks to control the visibility of elements.
- Redux Integration: Integrate Redux within an application using Redux concepts like actions, reducers, and the store.
- Rendering Dynamic Data: Dynamically render data fetched from an array of objects into the UI - map over arrays to generate lists of components.
- Handling Events and Conditional Rendering: Handle user events such as button selection and trigger corresponding actions.
